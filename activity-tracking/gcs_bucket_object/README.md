# Cloud Storage Bucket Object 

Checks if a Bucket Object exists within a project.

```
  storage       = handles['project_0.StorageV1']
  bucket_name   = resources['project_0']['startup_script.bucket_name']
  bucket_object = resources['project_0']['startup_script.bucket_object']
```

In the above code, the resources definition accesses a startup script value.
